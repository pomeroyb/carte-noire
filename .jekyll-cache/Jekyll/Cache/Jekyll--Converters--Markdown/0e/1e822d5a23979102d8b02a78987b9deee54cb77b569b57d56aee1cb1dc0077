<p>Having a 3D model of a printer design is nice, but no one knows if its just a pipe dream or reality! Fortunately for me, ConfinedXY is definitely a reality.</p>

<p>First step to building this bot was getting the aluminum 1/8‚Äù sheet water jet.

<p>Next we screwed the gantry‚Äôs outer frame to its corresponding 1515.

<p>We screwed down the bottom plate as well, using our 3D model as a reference.

<p>At this point, we realized that the black socket cap bolts we were using looked terrible‚Ä¶ so we unscrewed everything and replaced them with sexy stainless steel button heads.

<p>Next up was the internal supports‚Ä¶

<p>‚Ä¶And then we put on the linear rails.

<p>Our X cross beam is connected to the Y carriages by three M5 screws.

<p>Any bolts that were subject to vibrations got a liberal helping of Loctite.

<p>Tapping the holes for endstop boards and pulleys.

<p>A completed gantry!

<p>CoreXY designs rely on a lot of pulleys‚Ä¶ We started with 8mm bore 20 tooth GT2 pulleys.
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1252.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We then insert two MF83ZZ bearings into each pulley‚Ä¶

<p>And finally a bolt goes through.

<p>This pulley assembly gets screwed to the gantry frame.

<p>Moving on to the Z axis rails‚Ä¶
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1257.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And both rails are on! We only use two rails and carriages for our Z axis. The third leadscrew is floating.
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1258.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we attach the gantry to the rest of the frame.
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1261.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And we finally get a look at our completed bot skeleton!
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1262.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to get a good size reference from the photos‚Ä¶ so here‚Äôs ConfinedXY engulfing a MakerBot Replicator 2.
<img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1265.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not a bad build volume!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre waiting on a few more supplies before we move forward‚Ä¶ stay tuned!</p>

<p>When you have a 3D printer, you start to take the ability to make complex shapes for granted. Need a bracket that fits three different sizes of aluminum extrusion? No problem ‚Äì Just model it up and hit ‚Äúprint‚Äù!</p>

<p>Having to mill parts from a solid block is much more labor intensive, and requires more forethought. I tried to design as few machined parts as possible, but there were some areas where it was a necessary evil. For example, the extruder carriage mount.</p>

<p>We needed this part to mount to the carriage on the linear rail, and could not find an aluminum U-Channel that worked well‚Ä¶ so we made our own.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm very grateful that my printer build partner has both machining skill and access to a mill. Though the above part is technically the only part that <em>requires</em> a mill, there were other parts that benefitted from the accuracy of the mill.</p>

<p>A lot of these holes could have been made on a drill press, but it would have taken a lot longer to line them all up.</p>

<p>The mill also helped with our leadscrew nuts, which were not <em>exactly</em> the size we were expecting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt catch this error soon enough to backport it to our water jet files‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>Good enough! <i class="twa twa-sweat-smile"></i></p>

<p>Anyways, next step is assembling the Z-Axis. First the cross beam‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Then we attached the top plate. It‚Äôs held on with three M5 bolts, with springs and thumbscrews for easy levelling.</p>

<p>Then we loosely affixed the leadscrew nuts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1289.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, moment of truth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1290.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oh‚Ä¶. yes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1291.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the top.</p>

<p><img src="/images/confinedXY/IMAG1292.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the front.</p>

<p>Beautiful! <i class="twa twa-smiley"></i></p>

<p>What‚Äôs coming next? Belts! Stay tuned!</p>
